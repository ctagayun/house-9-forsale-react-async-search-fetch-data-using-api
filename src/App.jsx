/*
Inline Handler in JSX:
  Task: The application renders a list of items and allows 
its users to filter the list via a search feature. Next the 
application should render a button next to each list item 
which allows its users to remove the item from the list.
  Optional Hints:

   -The list of items needs to become a stateful value 
   (here: stateful array) with useState in order to manipulate 
   it (e.g. removing an item) later.

   - Every list item renders a button with a click handler. 
   When clicking the button, the item gets removed from the 
   list by manipulating the state.

   - Since the stateful list resides in the App component, 
    one needs to use callback handlers to enable the Item 
    component to communicate up to the App component for 
    removing an item by its identifier.
===============================================================
 Previous Task: Side Effect    
    This exercise will implement a feature that will enable Search component
 to remember the most recent searched. 

    Let's implement this feature by using a side-effect to store the recent search 
 from the browser's local storage and retrieve it upon the initial component 
 initialization. First, use the local storage to store the searchTerm accompanied
  by an identifier whenever a user types into the HTML input field:

   What is useEffect?
      - Use useEffect Hook to trigger the desired side-effect each time 
     the searchTerm changes:

      - Use effect automatically runs after React completes running
      the component pure functions and the browser has been updated.
      In the function the "EFFECT" is performed. So we can fetch data
      from an API for example.
 ==============================================================
 Previous Task: React Controlled Components Task:
    - we modified the Search component. We added the value attribute
      
    <div className="float-start ">
            <label htmlFor="search">Search:</label>
            <input id="search" 
              value={props.search} <-- We added the value attribute
              type="text"
              onChange={props.onSearch}/> 
            <p> 
              Searching for <strong>{props.search}</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
    
    Here we added a "value" attribute instead of giving the 
    html element the freedom of keeping track of its internal state.
    Instead React uses state by leveraging the "value" attribute.
    Whenever the HTML search ox element emits change event the NEW VALUE 
    is WRITTEN to React states and RE-RENDERS the component. Then
    the HTML element uses the recent state as value again.
    
    - As a result because of the "value" attribute the input textbox 
      became EXPLICITLY controlled element and Search component became 
      IMPLICITLY a controlled component.

    Interview Questions:
      Question 1: What is a controlled component in React?
        Answer: A controlled component is a component whose 
               FORM elements are controlled by React state. 
                 
      Question 2: How do you create a controlled input in React?
       Answer: Set the input VALUE attribute to a state variable 
       and provide an onChange handler to update the state.

      Question 3: What is the role of the value prop in a controlled input element?
       Answer: The value prop sets the current value of the input, 
       making it a controlled component.

      Question 4: How do you handle a controlled checkbox in React?
         Answer: Use the checked attribute and provide an 
         onChange handler to update the corresponding state.

      Question 5: How do you clear the value of a controlled component?
        Answer: Set the state variable to an empty or null value to 
        clear the value of a controlled component.

      Question 6 : What are the potential downsides of using controlled 
      components?
        Answer: Controlled components can lead to verbose code, 
        especially in forms with many input elements. 
  ===============================================================     
  Previous Tasks:
    - create a search component
    - add code to display only the houses based on the search
      result.
    - add instantiation of Search component in App.jsx

  ===============================================================     
  Previous Task:
     - Create HouseList component
     - see discussion about React state in HouseList component.
     
  ===============================================================     

  Previous Task:
  Setup: 
    npm install bootstrap
    Once the installation is complete, we can include it in our app’s 
    entry file in main.jsx :
    --  Bootstrap CSS
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
    -- Bootstrap Bundle JS
    import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";

    Now since we created the project with Vite, we can rely 
    on Vite's plugins to integrate ESLint properly. Run the 
    following command
       npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev
