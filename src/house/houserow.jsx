   Finally, the HouseRow component uses the incoming callback handler as a 
   function in a new handler. In this handler, we will pass the specific 
   item to it. Moreover, an additional button element is needed to trigger 
   the actual event:

   One popular solution is to use an inline arrow function, 
   which allows us to sneak in arguments like the item:
   <button type="button" onClick={() => onRemoveItem(item)}> 
        Dismiss
   </button>

    <tr>
     <td>{house.objectID} </td>
     <td>{house.address}</td>
     <td>{house.country}</td>
     <td>{currencyFormatter.format(house.price)}</td>
     <td>
     <span>
      <button className="btn btn-primary" type="button" onClick={() => onRemoveItem(house)}>
        Delete
      </button>
    </span>
     </td>
    </tr>

//Memoizing is way to cache the output of JSX component 
//so that it doesn't re-render. It is done by wrapping the 
//component with React.memo hook
const HouseRowMemoized = React.memo(HouseRow)

export default HouseRow;
//exporting the memoized version will let you use that 
//version in the HouseList
export {HouseRowMemoized};
